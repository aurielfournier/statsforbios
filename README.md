## Statistical techniques



### totalLeastSquares2013-09-06.R 	
Example total least squares analysis using `gx.rma` in `rgr`. Total least squares is a regression method that minimises the error in both x and y coordinates rather than just y. 


### jackknifeRegression13-05-04.R 	
140 char jackknife for confidence intervals of a OLS regression. 

### bootstrapRegression13-05-04.R 	
Very basic bootstrap of regression with 140 char version and fuller version. Bootstrap is used to calculate confidence intervals for a OLS regression.

### neuralNetworkExample2013-09-02.R 	
Simplest possible neural network analysis (machine learning method) using the `nnet` package.

### powerAnalysis03-10-13.R 	
Example power analysis. Used to make a plot of the sample size needed for a range of effect sizes. Performed using the `pwr` package


### smoothScatterDemo13-05-04.R 
Demonstration of `smoothScatter()` function that creates and plots a 2D kernel over a cloud of points.

  
  
  
## Programming techniques


### infixApplyFunctions2013-09-10.R 
Messing around with infix functions i.e. 2 + 2 is infix while add(2,2) is not. 
  
  
  
  

## Analysis I think is interesting

### anovaVswilcox2013-09-05.R 	
Compare power of anova and wilcox tests for a range of n, variance and difference in means.

  
  
  
  

## Plots for various uses 


### quantileRegressionData13-05-04.R 	
Just creating a plot of trangle like data that are common in ecology and a useful application of quantile regression. No quantile regression is actually run.

### surfaceForBanner2013-05-05.R 	
The 3D gaussian surface used as my twitter banner. Uses `persp` in `MASS`
