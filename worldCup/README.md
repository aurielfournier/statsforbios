# World cup twitter database analysis

[@tomaugust85](www.twitter.com/tomaugust85) sent this dataset of tweets from the world cup final. So I thought I'd have a go. 

Bear in mind that I have no idea what I'm doing. I've never worked with text data before. I've rarely worked with strings.

I'll try and keep the files here on git up to date.  


When do people tweet 'fuck'. I'm lacking imagination so far.
