# This file contains the functions I would be using.
# It could also contain the code that runs simulations/analysis.
# Or those could be kept in a seperate file, which might be better if I were running many seperate simulations etc.

# A function that squares the input
squareFunc <- function(y){
		z <- y^2
		}


# A function that I will deiliberately write badly so it fails
addAB <- function(a,b){
		y <- a+b
		return(a) #oops
		}
