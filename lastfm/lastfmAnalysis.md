Last.fm Data analysis
=======================


I discovered that you can download your [last.fm](www.last.fm) [data](http://www.last.fm/settings/dataexporter).
For those that don't use it, last.fm records all the music you listen to (as long as you listen on something that supports it) and records it for you.
It uses this data to give you recomendations of other artists you might like.
It also gives you weekly, monthly, 6 monthly lists of who you have been listening to.

If I go to a care home when I am old, I intend to put my last.fm profile in as part of my [care plan](http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/Yourhealth/Pages/Careplan.aspx).
I don't want to spend the last years of my life listening to cruddy music.

Anyway, you can now download all your data quite easily.
So here I will just have a play around and see what is interesting.
By the way, I am [t3h_m013](www.last.fm/user/t3h_m013) on last.fm.
This is an old and embaressing nickname... but oh well.


Read in the data
-----------------

First some libraries

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

Then read in the data.


```r
d <- read.table('data/scrobbles.tsv')
```

```
## Error: line 1091 did not have 15 elements
```

Ok. It doesn't work. Blerg. 

I've made a copy of the file and removed the offending line. I guess this will just move the error on to the next line with a similar problem.



```r
d <- read.table('data/scrobbles\ (copy).tsv')
```

```
## Error: line 1096 did not have 15 elements
```

Ok it's to do with quoted text inside song names. 
"07 - Excepts From ""The Six Wives Of Henry VIII""" for example. 
Funny that I've never encountered this before.



```r
d <- read.table('data/scrobbles.tsv', header = TRUE, sep = '\t', stringsAsFactors = FALSE, quote = "\"")
dim(d)
```

```
## [1] 104571     15
```

```r
names(d)
```

```
##  [1] "ISO.time"                "unixtime"               
##  [3] "track.name"              "track.mbid"             
##  [5] "artist.name"             "artist.mbid"            
##  [7] "uncorrected.track.name"  "uncorrected.track.mbid" 
##  [9] "uncorrected.artist.name" "uncorrected.artist.mbid"
## [11] "album.name"              "album.mbid"             
## [13] "album.artist.name"       "album.artist.mbid"      
## [15] "application"
```

Hooray. It works. 
We have some fairly obvious column names.
Note that last.fm matches incorrectly named artists.
So "uncorrected*" are the original data.

So let's look at some basic overview stuff.


```r
artistCounts <- data.frame(table(d$artist.name))
names(artistCounts)[1] <- 'Arists'

artistCounts[order(artistCounts$Freq, decreasing = TRUE), ] %>% head
```

```
##                  Arists Freq
## 1926       Van Morrison 5707
## 675        Frank Turner 2789
## 1356          Radiohead 2743
## 1651        The Beatles 2296
## 365  Coheed and Cambria 1819
## 1496          Sigur RÃ³s 1734
```

```r
ggplot(artistCounts, aes(x = Freq)) + 
  geom_density()
```

Ok, the top artists match.

And as expected, there's a few artists with loads of listen, and lots of artists with very few listens.
