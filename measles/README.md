Measles visualization
======================


This directory is for playing around with vizualisations of measles (and possibly other) datasets.

The raw data is in [MEASLES_Incidence_1928-2003_20150409110701.csv](MEASLES_Incidence_1928-2003_20150409110701.csv). This data is licensed under a CCPL license which is included in [Project Tychoâ„¢ License Agreement.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/timcdlucas/statsforbios/blob/master/measles/Project%20Tycho%E2%84%A2%20License%20Agreement.html).


[measlesviz.md](measlesviz.md) is my attempt at the heatmap style plot that is how I found out about this data is the first place.

[measlesExtraViz.md](measlesExtraViz.md) is where I will play around with any other ideas.
